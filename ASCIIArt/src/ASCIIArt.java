/**
 * Unit 1 Project
 * 
 * In this project you have the opportunity to create a piece of artwork using ASCII 
 * (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). Using the already created file 
 * named `ASCIIArt.java` write a program that outputs your artwork to the console. 
 * The goal of this project is to use ONLY what we have learned in Unit 1 to create 
 * anything you would like so be creative (and school appropriate). Artwork must also have a caption describing what it's depicting.  
 * 
 * For those of you who have dabbled in coding before, try to contain your code to 
 * just what we have discussed in this unit.
